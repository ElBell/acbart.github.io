Two master auto-makers decided to set up Artisan Auto-making schools next door to each other. Although they had different views on teaching, the two masters became quick friends. Master Alfred lived on the left and Master Zen lived on the right. At the time, artisan cars were the driving force of the economy, so both schools were quickly enrolled to their maximum. 

"Although we are teaching them auto-making, we are really teaching them more than just about cars," Master Alfred said to Master Zen, who nodded in return. "Auto-making is a way of life that will change the way they look at the world." Master Zen agreed with Master Alfred again.

In the first week of classes, Master Alfred stood before his students and gave a stirring speech on the marvels of cars and the theory behind movement. He spoke passionately about the way wheels should be circular, and how the engine was really just an extrapolation of the drive cylinders, if you thought about it. By the end of the week, he set his students the task of creating a chassis for their first car.

Finishing his lesson early, Master Alfred wandered next door to check on Master Zen. He was surprised to see Zen's students creating skateboards. He waited patiently for Zen to finish his work, and then quietly took him aside.

"Good Master Zen, it seems that you may have been confused, your students are creating skateboards instead of cars. How will they learn to make the perfect car if they are making something else?"

Zen smiled. "Cars will come later, for now they must make skateboards," responded Zen serenely. Alfred was concerned, but returned to his school.

By the end of the second week, Alfred's students had finished their chassis. A strict task master, Alfred sized up each one and found them all wanting. They did not yet appreciate the struggles that the chassis would encounter, Alfred realized, but he explained carefully to them the need for a tough frame. Satisfied that they understood the desired changes, he moved them onto the next task of creating the engine.

Once again finishing early, Alfred went next door to make sure Zen had started his students on building their engines. He was aghast to find that the students were instead constructing bicycles. He once again pulled his colleague aside.

"My good friend Zen, what do you have your students doing? In the second week, they must start creating an engine - as the fundamental force of the car, understanding its properties is critical."
