In the past year, I've had a growing interest in formal methods of Instructional Design. One of my new favorite activities is writing learning objectives. I'm still developing that skill, but I though it would be interesting to share some of the objectives I've written for the Computational Thinking course. As you can see, there are a large number of learning objectives, and I doubt we actually cover all of them in the CT course. There's still a lot to improve about the curriculum. There's also a lot to improve about these outcomes. I noticed while reviewing them that there isn't anything about students working with nested control structures, for instance.

        *   State the control structures of algorithms

        *   Code an abstraction as an integer, string, Boolean, list, dictionary
