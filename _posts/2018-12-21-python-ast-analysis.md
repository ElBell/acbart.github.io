I decided to clean up some analysis I did a while back about Python Abstract Syntax Trees. The thought was to download a mass of Python code and look at how Python programmers use various syntactic elements. I had thoughts about turning this into a paper, but I figured a blog post might be all I had the investment for. This represents a pretty shallow effort, in the end. But I merged all the code into a Jupyter Notebook, added some notes, and now you can check it out on GitHub: [Python AST Element Analysis](https://github.com/acbart/python-ast-analysis/blob/master/Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
