Before the end of last year, I posted a blog asking, "What do we know about CS1?" The goal was to list some things that I felt we had good evidence for, based on research I'd read over the years. It wasn't a deep dive into the literature, just shooting from the hip on a subject I theoretically know a lot about. But when I posted about it on Twitter, I was surprised when Mark Guzdial recommended a very lengthy paper answering my question almost exactly! I was relieved to learn that it had only appeared in the past few days, so I wasn't a bad researcher for missing it. However, I was very surprised by some of the results identified in the paper. I think my main takeaway is that we know less than I thought.

The entire paper is worth a close read, and I've now done two passes. If you're interested in doing research at the CS1 level, I think it's worth a read yourself. However, I wanted to summarize the blog post from a teacher perspective, hopefully making the salient results accessible. Therefore, you should view this blog post as a focused summary, not a complete review or abstract of the paper. In other words, I might skip some good stuff if I can't find a connection to my teaching!
