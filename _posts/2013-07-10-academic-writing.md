title: What Academia Needs to Do About Writing

**TL;DR: We need more formatting and simpler papers in academia.**

This is probably controversial and said by every disgruntled graduate student.

## Academic Writing is bad

Compare these three processes:

* Writing a published paper:

    1. Create an outline
    2. Iteratively expand that outline into prose
    
* Reading a published paper (Fantasy):

    1. Read the prose
    2. For each section, construct a mental outline/notes of the section
    
* Reading a published paper (Reality):

    1. Read the abstract
    2. Read the conclusion
    3. Look at the graphs

The disconnect between reality and fantasy is because the paper is:

* too **dragged-out** (minimum and maximum page counts)
* too **verbose** (big words make us sound smarter)
* **not easy to skim** (no one likes paragraphs)

When writing for the internet, you avoid that disconnect as much as possible:

* You use **lists** instead of writing things out
* You use **emphasis** and **images** healthily
* You only release PDFs when you expect the content to be printed, and you never have two columns.

Think about how crazy our two-column papers are!

1. We take complicated ideas and make them more complicated,
2. we write them up as raw text with programatically-specified formatting,
3. solidify it into a un-resizable format,
4. slice it into two-columns, and
5. shove it on the web in an inflexible format

I'm not advocating incomplete sentences stuffed into a rough tree outline. But there should be a happy medium between ugly paragraphs and web-oriented writing. I want this blog to be as accessible as possible.
