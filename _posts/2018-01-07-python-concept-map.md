While designing the next iteration of my "Introduction to Python Teacher's Field Guide", I laid out a basic concept map for the course content.

This graph is hardly complete: it barely scratches the surface of the data science components (e.g., web data, plotting), and doesn't really show much depth there is to the unit on functions. You might think that IF statements, FOR loops, and WHILE loops are on par with each other - but that's not really accurate, since FOR loops take the bulk of that time. Similarly, tuples get one lesson while Lists and Dictionaries have much more time spent on them.

  

Still, I think it's an interesting way to organize the big ideas of the course.
