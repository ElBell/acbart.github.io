Rhinestone
----------

A web-based textbook/course delivery system for an introductory Computational Thinking class. An extension of the popular Runestone platform totally rewritten in Flask. Incorporates a number of novel elements including real-time collaboration, a block-based programming environment, and useful feedback mechanisms.

A collection of tools and documents designed to smooth XO development, developed in collaboration with Robert Deaton and Eric McGinnis.

  

Platipy consists of:

*   An online tutorial for XO Activity Development ([Site](http://platipy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)).
*   Example.activity, a skeleton of a basic XO laptop game and a packaged set of useful python modules (e.g. simplejson)
*   [**Spyral**](https://github.com/platipy/spyral), a Pygame replacement for developing games quickly and effectively
*   Conspyre, a school-oriented networking framework and API for the XO that persists data and provides communication between teachers and students
*   Syllabearus, an open-source, semester-targetted game design curriculum with a focus on teaching educational theory and high level game design to Computer Science majors

  

Animal Science Minecraft Mod
----------------------------

A modification for Minecraft that introduces mechanics designed to teach Animal Science concepts, developed in collaboration with Eleonor Cayford. A full blogpost on the project is published [here](https://sites.google.com/a/vt.edu/acbart-eportfolio/blog/learncraftandanimalsciencecraft).

  
Topics covered by this modification, based on [FFA learning standards](https://www.ffa.org/documents/learn/FINAL_AFNR_Standards_v3_2_4_6_09.pdf), include:

*   Animal naming taxonomy (e.g., "Sow" vs. "Boar" vs. "Piglet")
*   Approaching animals safely
*   Hybrid Vigor

Pokemon Battle Analyzer
-----------------------

A analyzer for a classical, turn-based video game utilizing Sparse-Matrix Analysis to quickly navigate a massive probabilistic state space. This system can accurately identify outcomes of match-ups between two players.

#### Virginia Tech Computer Science Graduate Student Homepage System

A utility for Virginia Tech CS Grad Students to upload a structured file containing their academic information, which then makes them [searchable](http://csgrad.cs.vt.edu/search/) on the Graduate Council website. A structured, real-time [editor](http://csgrad.cs.vt.edu/edit/) is also available on the graduate council website.

#### Functional Programming Game

This is a proof-of-concept for an interesting gameplay mechanic where you compose functions/data LISP-style to satisfy predicates. The demo uses a turn-based combat as the context, but there other possibilities available. If you are having trouble, click the tutorial button in the lower right. Try it out at [www.acbart.com/fpg-demo/](http://www.acbart.com/fpg-demo/).
